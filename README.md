Erlang module to convert and send cover data to coveralls.

## Example usage: rebar and Travis CI                                                                           
In order to use coveralls-erl + Travis CI in your project you will need to add the following lines to your `rebar.config.script`:                                                                                                
```erlang
case os:getenv("TRAVIS") of
  "true" ->
    JobId   = os:getenv("TRAVIS_JOB_ID"),
    CONFIG1 = lists:keystore(coveralls_service_job_id, 1, CONFIG, {coveralls_service_job_id, JobId}),
    lists:keystore(plugins, 1, CONFIG1, {plugins, [rebar_coveralls]});
  _ ->
    CONFIG
end.
end.
```

This will ensure that rebar_coveralls will have access to the needed JobId and that the plugin is only run from Travis CI.

You will also need to add the following lines to your `rebar.config`:
```erlang                                                                                                       
{deps                   , [ { coveralls
                            , ".*"
                            , {git, "git://github.com/markusn/coveralls-erl.git", "master"}
                            }
                          ]}.
{plugin_dir             , "deps/coveralls/src"}.
{cover_enabled          , true}.
{cover_export_enabled   , true}.
{coveralls_coverdata    , ".eunit/eunit.coverdata"}.
{coveralls_service_name , "travis-ci"}.
```
These changes will add `coveralls-erl` as a dependency, tell `rebar` where to find the plugin, make sure that the coverage data is produced and exported and configure `coveralls-erl` to use this data and the service `travis-ci`. 

With these modifications to your rebar configuration `rebar_coveralls` will run after EUnit is finished and export the coverage data to coveralls.

NOTE: It may be a good idea to add your own `rebar` binary to your repository to ensure that Travis CI runs with a rebar binary that supports the needed `cover_export_enabled` option.
